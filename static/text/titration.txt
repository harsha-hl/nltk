Pour few drops of Phenolpthalein solution from container to conical flask containing HCl.
Fill the burette with NaOH (titrant) of known concentration and place it over the conical flask. 
Slowly drop it over the NaOH solution from burette to the conical flask till equivalence point is reached and HCl acid is completely neutralized. 
Upon neutralisation, the solution in conical flask becomes purple in colour confirming the end point of the reaction.
The concentration of HCl analyte is calculated by measuring the amount of NaOH added.
