Add a few drops of dilute H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) from conical flask to a small quantity of the salt in a test tube.
Light brown gas with a pungent smell is evolved from the test tube.
The anion maybe Nitrate.
Add Iron(II) Sulphate from beaker to the test tube containing salt solution.
Add acid (H2SO4) from the container to the corners of the test tube. 
 A Brown ring is formed at the junction of the acid and the solution in the test tube.
Nitrate is confirmed. 

Add a few drops of Hcl from container to the test tube containing salt solution.
No change observed.
To the above solution in test tube, pass H2S gas.
No changes observed.
Add NH4Cl from conical flask to the test tube containing salt solution and then add excess NH4OH.
Add ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, and ammonium hydroxide from conical flask to the original solution in the test tube.
Black precipitate is obtained in the test tube.
Cation maybe Barium, Strontium or Calcium.
Add K2Cr2O4 from conical flask to test tube containing salt solution. A yellow precipitate is formed in the test tube.
CAtion maybe Ba2+
Make a paste of the salt by mixing it in a petri dish. Add a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid from container to petri dish . Now skim off some of the paste with a glass rod and expose it above a Bunsen Burner’s flame.
Green coloured flame of bunsen burner confirms Ba2+ as cation.
